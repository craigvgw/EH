has it's own built into package it seems


goto an empty directory
run npm install pixi.js

will download the latest pixi package


in the latest package, can probably just point to each of the index.d.ts files in each of the folders, one by one in a list.

that will probably work, only need index.d.ts from each folder

folders are eg
accessibility
app
compressed-textures

etc
